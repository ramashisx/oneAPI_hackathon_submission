"What are we going to do in here all day?" asked Billy. 

"I don't know" said Joey, looking out the window as the rain came down. 

Harder. And harder. 

"Oh no! I left my baseball glove outside" said Joey as he watched it begin to fill up with rain. His glove was going to be a mess! 

Thankfully, Joey's dad pulled up in his car. Seeing the glove on the ground, he picked it up as he ran inside. 

"Careful sport, you almost lost this" he told his son as he tossed him the wet mitt. But Joey wasn't listening, he was looking past his dad as he walked through the door. The sky was clearing up! Joey ran outside, Billy came after him. 

"Look at that!" Billy said as he pointed at the sky. A rainbow was appearing, it was so beautiful! The rain wasn't bad after all!"""
